# GGSN Throughput Forecasting

**Disclaimer**: This repo is made for the purpose of showcasing data forecasting skill only. I modified the original dataset since it is confidential. Some fields were renamed and the values were transformed.

## Project Description
I was working on a GGSN (Gateway GPRS Support Node) throughput forecasting project for a network operator client. The goal is to predict future data traffic using historical data provided. While seasonal variations might be present, the main focus is on identifying long-term trends. This will help the client plan network capacity, optimize resource allocation, and proactively address potential bottlenecks. Through data analysis, model development, and evaluation, I created a forecasting solution that anticipates future GGSN throughput and empowers the client to make strategic network decisions.

## Tools
